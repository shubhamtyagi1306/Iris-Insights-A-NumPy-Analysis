# **Data Analysis and Visualization with Python and NumPy**

## **Project Description**
This project is a comprehensive exploration of data analysis using Python and the NumPy library. The primary focus is to clean, preprocess, and analyze a dataset while applying statistical and linear algebra concepts. The project uses the **Iris Dataset**, a popular dataset containing measurements of different iris flower species, to demonstrate how to handle real-world data.

## **Process**
### 1. **Data Loading**
- Loaded the Iris dataset from a CSV file using NumPyâ€™s `genfromtxt` function.
- Extracted numeric features and categorical labels for separate analysis.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Identified and handled missing values by replacing them with the column mean.
- Ensured all features were in a numerical format suitable for computation.

### 3. **Data Normalization**
- Applied Min-Max Scaling to normalize the features to a range of [0, 1].
- Normalization ensured that all features contributed equally to statistical analysis and distance-based computations.

### 4. **Statistical Analysis**
- Calculated key statistics, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and correlation between features.
- Built a correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.

### 5. **Linear Algebra Applications**
- Solved example systems of linear equations using NumPy to demonstrate its linear algebra capabilities.
- Performed operations like matrix multiplication, eigenvalue computation, and determinant calculation.

### 6. **Data Visualization**
- Created an ASCII-based histogram to visualize the distribution of the features.
- Saved the processed dataset for external use with advanced visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn (optional).
